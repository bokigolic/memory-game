### How to Play
- Start the game by clicking on a card. The card will automatically flip over to reveal its image.
- Click on another card to try and find its matching pair. If the cards match, you will receive points.
- If the cards do not match, they will flip back over, and you can continue trying to find matching pairs.
- The game ends when all pairs have been found.
- You can see your score and time on the top of the board.
